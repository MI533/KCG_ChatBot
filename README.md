Steps in Chatbot Created for KCG College of Technology:


   1. The chat file written in python language reads the backend database which contains the details
      about the customer.
      
   2. The chat application retrieves those sentences that match the user query.
   
   3. Natural Language Tool Kit Library is used for token matching.
   
   4. First NLTK Library updates its tokens by updating is wordnet, punkt packages.
   
   5. The details in the database are converted into sentences.The details are taken from the wikipedia college
      site:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KCG_College_of_Technology
   
   6. Sentences are converted into words.
   
   7. Concepts like Stopwords Removal, Stemming are applied.
   
   8. After step 7, only those tokens will remain the backend database.
   
   9. When user inputs a query, the query that matches with tokens in the backend database is
      retrieved as response by the system to the user.
Eg:
What about Placement in your college?
Stemming: Place
Stopwords: Place is present.
So it will not retrieve any results for the keyword placement.
